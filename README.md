Set up the GUI.
Make and set up every button.
Put the buttons in a grid pattern.
To listen for button clicks and respond appropriately, start the event loop.
Button_click, button_operator, button_equal, and button_clear are the functions that are called when a button is clicked.
Continue until the program is closed by the user.
